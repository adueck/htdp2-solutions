; (game-ball game0)
; selects the ball field of game0
; this yields (make-posn 200 200)
; which was created by passing the CENTER constant
; which was computed by taking (quotient WIDTH 2)

; (posn? (game-ball game0))
; sees if the ball field of game0 is indeed a posn
; it returns #true because it is a posn
; we put in (make-posn CENTER CENTER) for the ball field
; while making game0

; (game-left-player game0)
; selects the left-player field of game0
; this returns 100, which is the value of MIDDLE
; which we created at the beginning with (quotient HEIGHT 2)
