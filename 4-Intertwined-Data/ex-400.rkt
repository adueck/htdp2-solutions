; I have simplified DNAprefix and DNAdelta as far as possible, as far
; as I can see. I started designing with the a table based on a cond
; statement with all possible cases (combinations of input possibilities),
; then I used the laws of logic to see how I could simplify the logic into
; the shortest statements/least decisions possible. It's amazing to see how
; after all those manipulations the problem is essentially boiled down to a
; simplified version of the solution that can be explained as in English with
; the comments, but of which I can be confident is 100% logically sound and can
; cover all the test-cases and presumably anything else that could possibly
; get thrown at it. The HTDP design process is awesome! ðŸ’ª
